            My name is Yuqing Wu.But everyone calls me Oliver,the reason I use it named myself is because the protagonist of an American drama that I was obsessed with called Oliver,Oliver Queen from ‘Arrow’，a typical drama about individual heroes.

            I am 100% Chinese and I am proud of my country. I live in Guangdong province which is in the south part of China so I can speak three different languages, Mandarin, Cantonese as well as English because Cantonese is the local dialect of Guangdong. Due to the reason that the city I live is close to some famous cities in the world such as ShenZhen and HongKong, my English ability has also been exercised. China is well known as a country with a long history and it has made a great contribution to the world culture. For example the Great Wall, the Imperial Palace, Terra-Cotta Warriors. Some traditional festivals as well, the Spring Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival. Every traditional festival has its own story handed down from generation to generation. Actually China is a diverse and tolerant country,but she still has her own unique charm.

            As for me, I am crazy about basketball. I like the sound that teammates celebrate when we win the game, the sound of basketball hitting the net, the magnificent dribble. I believe that is where my passion comes from. Music is also an indispensable part of my life. I think music is another way for people to share life and describe their mood.The most interesting thing is I am used to listen to music while I was sleeping.Its like the white noise clams me down.I also love movies very much. I think each movie is the director’s own understanding of the world.The process of watching a movie is like understanding other people’s thinking to discover different ideas and beliefs.

            I took this picture in January this year on a very famous mountain called Mount Hua in China.To be honest,the cat's elegant and dignified posture attracted me, even on such a cold hilltop.
